    <p>My only experience with coding has been with HTML and CSS for a few years. When I was younger, I used to mess around with Javascript
        but never continued with it. It's still something that I would like to learn more about, since the capabilities with Javascript are
        different than what can be done with HTML and CSS. On the CSS side, I'm not the most proficient however I always found myself being 
        good at learning more tricks. Most of my experience mostly lies with the overall design of a page, and I'm still learning a lot when
        it comes to creating the website itself. While there are websites like Weebly that make it easy to create your own website, it's much
        more beneficial and rewarding to learn how to create it yourself as it gives you the freedom to customize it to your liking. While I'm
        not the best at coding, I find it enjoyable to create something from scratch, especially something that you're proud of.

    <p>I want to learn more about ways to find out how to design a webpage to your liking. The frustrating part about coding for webpages is that
        often times you have an idea in your head about what you want something to look like, however most times it's difficult to put that into 
        practice. I want to learn more ways about how to figure out what to code into my HTML and CSS files so that the image in my head can be put
        into my code. With that being said, there are plenty of possibilities when it comes to your CSS designs, and I want to explore them all. 
        I think that while my HTML proficiency is somewhat adequate, what I'd like to work on more is how I can code my CSS in ways that make me 
        proud of what I've created.
